# Projects
## CMS Value-Based Programs Financial and Readmission Analysis
- [Repo](https://github.com/Smittyxc/sql-cms-database)

Using data sourced from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, created a relational database in **MySQL** involving Disproportionate Share Hospital, Hospital Readmission Reduction, and Efficiency and Cost Reduction Program data. Once data was processed to incorporate only facilities using similar CMS reimbursement structures, exploratory data analysis was performed to identify potential trends between readmission rates and financial reimbursement datapoints. Insights from this data-driven approach can be used distinguish poor performing facilities or regions with the intent of further research to bridge these care deficits. Included queries can further narrow the analysis scope by filtering Diagnosis Related Groups, a CMS metric that can reveal trends in specific patient populations

## Rocking Climbing Python Web Scraper and MySQL Database
- [Repo](https://github.com/Smittyxc/rock-climbing-mysql-database)

[Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/) is a user-driven repository of rock climbing routes worldwide, containing information on route's difficulty, rating, popularity, subarea, and more. This project uses BS4 to gather route data grouped by climbing area from Mountain Project, which is stored in a CSV file. The file is then imported into a MySQL database with MySQL Connector. Each area is contained within its own table that can be queried to identify trends at specific areas.

## West Michigan Cycling Safety Dashboard
- [Excel Workbook](https://github.com/Smittyxc/mi-cycling-safety-dashboard)

With MI Office of Highway Safety Planning collision data, a comprehensive cycling safety dashboard was designed with novel metrics, primarily focusing on West Michigan from 2018-2022. Excel was used to prepare, process, and share data using a variety of functions and features including Vlookup, PivotTables, array formulas, and geographic charts. The exploratory analysis found upticks in collisions at certain times of day and in certain speed zones, as well as identified geographic hotspots using mapping functionality. Similarly, analysis was performed on on impaired drivers and found correlations with hit and run rates.
